Here we are, 3 days after the launch and people are trolling here and there.

I offered the community a truly 'free' alternative to crapware which forces you to buy "commercial"
licenses in order to see the complete non-obfucated source code and stuff like that; this was the primary reason
why I released it under a really permissive BSD license.

It seems that people just don't need an alternative, they can do something better on their own, so I decided
to take off the source from the internetz and let it rust in a dark corner of my HDD.

To all the trolls (not to be mistaken with the guys from Trolltech) out there, FUCK YOU TOO!

I made it public, I take it away! I'm your GOD!
