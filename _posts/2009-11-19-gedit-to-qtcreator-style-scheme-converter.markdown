I forged a little script in Python to convert Gedit color schemes into color schemes commestible by QtCreator. The source code can be found on GitHub as usual right <a title="Get the source right now!" href="http://github.com/icebreaker/g2q" target="_blank">here</a> .

Any contributions, comments, etc are welcome, especially because this is very very basic, but it's more than enough for my rather primitive taste :)

Enjoy and Happy Hacking!
