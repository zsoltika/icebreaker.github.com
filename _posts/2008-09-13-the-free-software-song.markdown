<em><strong>The Lyrics</strong></em>
<blockquote>Join us now and share the software;
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.
x2

Hoarders can get piles of money,
That is true, hackers, that is true.
But they cannot help their neighbors;
That's not good, hackers, that's not good.

When we have enough free software
At our call, hackers, at our call,
We'll kick out those dirty licenses
Ever more, hackers, ever more.

Join us now and share the software;
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.
x2</blockquote>
