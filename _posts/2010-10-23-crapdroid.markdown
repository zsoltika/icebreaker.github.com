### Where Google Went Wrong?

The most important *issue* is their very own fork of the Linux kernel which no longer can be merged with the upstream
kernel. You can read more about this right [here](http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/android-kernel-problems.html).

The second thing is that if you take a look at Android, you will realize pretty quickly that it's not that *open* after all
or *as advertised*, because of the GPLv2 kernel there's nothing we can do about this; all those *smart-phones* running modified
(binary and proprietary) versions of Android, most of the time won't let you, or be able to run **your** own version. 
Again, more about this over [here](http://www.techworld.com.au/article/356590/q_richard_stallman).

Third, the language of choice *Java*. While Java is a nice language, it's not really known for his speed and low memory 
requirements which are key elements for a low-power-consumption device like a smart-phone. Of course when Google realized
this poor *decision*, tried to supplement it with the **NDK**, which is nothing more but a good joke.

It's unacceptable to use a 1Ghz CPU just to be able to run the operating system smoothly because 80% of the CPU time is eaten
up by the garbage collector. Obviously this is a major benefit for the Hardware Vendors.

Fragmentation is the result of competition, the *market* will settle down to a couple of major vendors over the years,
that's what happened in the PC scene as well, so anybody who argues against Android by mentioning the *fragmentation*
issue has no idea about what he is talking about.

### Where Nokia & Intel Went Right?

Why reinvent the wheel and create a brand new *distribution* or *operating system*, when you can cherry-pick
the components out there and build something awesome; this is the joy of FLOSS.

#### Nokia

![Maemo]({{ site.url }}/images/2010/10/maemo.png)

How could one possibly go wrong with a combination of [the Linux kernel](kernel.org), [Debian](debian.org) and [Gnome](gnome.org)
resulting in [Maemo](http://maemo.org/development/) ?

#### Intel

![Moblin]({{ site.url }}/images/2010/10/moblin.jpg)

Just like Nokia, a winner combination of the [the Linux kernel](kernel.org), and [Gnome](gnome.org) resulting in [Moblin](moblin.org) .

#### God said let there be MeeGo ...

Android fan-boys I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the joint efforts of Intel and Nokia created a far better *platform*, a true
*platform* based on FLOSS for both smart-phones and net-books known as [MeeGo](http://meego.com/developers/meego-architecture).

### Microsoft? Windows 7 Phone Edition?

Not responding.

### Apple? iPhone?

iWhore? iFloor? Anyone?
