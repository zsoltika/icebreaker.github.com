### Update

It was about time for a ***status update*** regarding Lemon Tea. I'm trying to keep it simple and not over engineer 
it, because this is mainly a prototype and later is to be decided if it is worth continuing and transforming it into
a full blown *World Editor* for **Lera3D**.

*Highlights*:

* QDockWidgets
* Scene Editor (started)
* Property Editor (started, via the QT add-on)
* Console Log (captures all qDebug())
* lots of work on the internals (i.e asset load/save to XML)

### Rant

I'm going to blend this with the update just not to make another totally separate post. (I'm lazy **sigh**)

This morning I noticed [Syntensity's](http://syntensity.com) author's new post on the 
[development blog](http://syntensity.blogspot.com/2010/03/move-to-permissive-license.html) about re-licensing 
[Syntensity](http://syntensity.com/) under a *more permissive* BSD *like* license.

I'm interested in this matter because I'm about to release Lemon Tea and then Lera3D sometime in the near future
and choosing a **good** license is vital, because it can affect the adoption; a non-favorable license might totally reduce
the interest.

I'm kind of falling for GPLv3 even if that's going to lead to a huge fragmentation, but at **least** it guarantees that
nobody will just take a fork and turn it into closed source; on the other hand this would make it impossible to use it in any 
kind of commercial application, but this can be solved if the commercial licenses are negotiated on a case-to-case basis, 
so Indies could get a license for a much lower price than a full blown game studio with 30 full-time employees.

Just like good old **Richard Stallman** said, those who promote *Open Source* and *Free Software* they do not promote it with the
**freedom** as the reason why.

I uploaded two episodes from the [Go Open](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Open_Source) *source campaign* on Vimeo 
(*feat.* **Richard Stallman**) .
