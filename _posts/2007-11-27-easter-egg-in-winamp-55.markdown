I did a search after I found this on Google and found nothing relevant, so maybe I'm the first one who discovered this. :))

To see the easter egg, start winamp, go to the "Preferences" then to "Modern Skins" and select the last tab which says "Current Skin", then double click on the "Bento" text, BOOOM! there you have a nice "snake" like game :))

Enjoy, and have fun!!!

PS: be sure to eat all the Lamas !!! Haha!
