This is a bit old -- it was released by the Northern Dragons demo group, but it's still an useful resource for someone who wants to break into the "demo scene". :)) It contains useful tutorials, examples, which can be useful even for those who are planning to make a 64k intro, or why not a "demo" which can be up to 16mb :)

I definitely found it useful -- so greetz fly out to <a href="http://www.northerndragons.ca/" title="Norther Dragons" target="_blank">Northern Dragons</a> :))

... oh yeah -- you can get it <a href="http://www.scene.org/file.php?file=/resources/docs/nd_4kb_intro_kit.zip&amp;fileinfo" title=")" target="_blank">here</a>.
