**WARNING**: this post is going to be a rather long and boring one so you might 
consider skipping it altogether, just to save both of us from any headaches
that might pop-up along the journey into the deep fires of Mount Doom; arggh 
sorry that was for another post called ... Lord of ... arrggh forgot the name.

This is more like a **resolution** type of thing (if you will), 
because I don't think that I'll write another blog post by the end of this year 
(or maybe yes ... who knows?), plus it will shed some light on some more obscure 
things I didn't mention or discussed about (publicly!) earlier.

Everything you read about here might be subject to change, so don't take it
as written in stone, be sure to keep that in mind.

Lera3D
------
Loyal subscribers of this blog maybe have noticed that, occasionally I might 
mention **Lera3D**, the cross platform 3D game engine and framework I'm hacking
together for a number of years now. Iteration after iteration, this year I 
arrived to the point where I'm happy with the architecture in overall (not 100%
yet) so a lot of good stuff are ahead for 2011, stay tuned!

All I can say for now is that it will be dual licensed, GPLv3 and indie friendly
commercial, (under 1000$, full game engine and tool source code, initially
Linux, Mac OSX and Windows with more platforms coming later), all further 
information will be given on a *need-to-know* basis when the time comes.

Also registered [lera3d.org](http://lera3d.org) and [leradoc.org](http://leradoc.org),
will host all the related material including documentation; both redirect to 
[leragames.com](http://www.leragames.com) at this point.

People ask me all the time about the infamous *origins* of the **L.e.r.a** (3D) 
acronym, so let me break the news for you **Lera is Entertainment Right Ahead**; if you are a 
slightly more *Romantic soul*, lets take a different route  *V*.*a*.**L**.**E**.**R**.*i*.**A**; 
it's totally up to you, how you dare to decipher the deep secrets of this quite playful piece of word geekery.

Lera Games
----------
I came up with the name **Lera Games** last year and registered the domain 
[leragames.com](http://www.leragames.com) at about the same time in order to use 
it as an *umbrella name* to release *Lera3D* with the tools when the time comes.
(no ETA!)

Initially, I made a long list and considered a few *non-Lera* alternatives, but
I (and others, a respected closed circle of trustees like *Panda the great*) 
liked *Lera Games* the most; there you go!

As of now [Lera Games](http://www.leragames.com) is a core team of two, 
[Melissa Davidson](http://www.melissadavidson.net) and [Mihail Szabolcs](http://www.szabster.net) (me!)
but we are looking into expanding the team over the course of next year, slowly but surely with at
least one or two additional *artists* and hopefully begin outsourcing some of the *Audio*
production from this early stage for the first episode of our **Ancestria** *franchise* and *flagship
title* called **Ancestria: Flux** (*Episode 1*) .

We are not rolling full time yet, Melissa is (also) working as a freelancer and 
I have a full-time day job, but hopefully this will change soon. *shrugs*

The dinosaurette in the room, Melissa ...
-----------------------------------------
Earlier this year, at the beginning of the beautiful month of August, I was still
looking for an artist, but more like a partner in crime to begin the production 
of the game idea I had, which would be built along side with game engine showcasing
key features and visual richness.

After emailing *>100* various artists, looking through their portfolios, asking them
for hourly rates, etc, etc; Melissa popped up out of the blue and suddenly
became the perfect candidate (from day one!). 

It's *very* hard to find somebody who truly enjoys their work, and it's passionate
about every single thing related to it; nowadays the world is full of fake punk asses
who work *just* for the money, *just* because their parents, friends or whoever said
that the certain *profession* is well paid and they should do it anyway, even if they
do not see the sense of it, not even a tiny bit.

They work 8h straight without giving a fuck, break things, do a shitty job and go 
home leaving behind broken, unfinished or just plain bad quality things.

Most certainly I wasn't looking for any of *those*, and I can wholeheartedly say
that I would recommend Melissa to anybody at any given time, without even thinking
about it, just because I know that she does a great job plus she's open minded
and a top-notch learner.

Ancestria
---------
By the end of August, after lengthy discussion threads, we have sealed the *deal* 
and started forging the yet unnamed game which later became known as *Ancestria* .

I'm not going to reveal much (for now!), but Ancestria is an action-adventure, with the 
action taking place in an unique steampunk world.

Once more, I registered bravely [ancestriagame.com](http://www.ancestriagame.com/) as a
dedicated all-in-one-place for all things Ancestria.

We didn't bother with tons of *advertising*, *marketing* and *PR* at this point
but we'll pick up speed later as we shoot to have a playable demo ready for IGF. *cough, cough!*

(We are just the 666th of the indies who will do the same next year, and most probably
we'll miss it, but it's good to keep it in mind, as a productivity booster if nothing else)

Ancestria [Christmas] Special
-----------------------------
What's the deal with this one? Well well, along the way sometime by the end of October
we decided that *maybe* we should shoot for a 2D (possibly Flash) game and have it
ready before Christmas, hence the name [Ancestria Christmas Special](http://www.ancestriagame.com); 
using some existing and well defined elements from our main Ancestria *game design* document; 
like our heroines Vera and Maria. (guys sssh ... no worries, we got a heroe as well!)

As I'm fluent in a dozen of languages and coding game technology myself, 
I'm always more than eager to try out other people's tools, 
and it was no different this time with [Love2D](http://love2d.org) and [Flixel](http://flixel.org).

Now with the 2D game, I had an *excuse* to mess around with them, and ultimately
create something awesome, while Melissa started working on the necessary artwork,
plus I was going on vacation for the whole month of December. (perfect timing, I'd say!)

### Love2D

So, started building a rough prototype of the game with Lua, it's always 10x faster
to prototype in it, than any other language, except maybe JavaScript (they are kind of on par in my agenda).

I found Love2D to have a quite clean and well documented API, very very generic
and it doesn't get in your way much; this was a pleasant experiment and experience.

Sometime in mid-November, I realized that there is no time to build up the whole game
in Love2D and then port it over to Flixel (or FlashPunk) .

### FlashPunk & Flixel

This wasn't a *pons asinorum* type of thing, because like I said above, I'm fluent
in JavaScript, but I find some of the limitations and type-safety in AS3 quite
annoying and last but not least insulting. I do understand that it's a lot more
easier to create well optimized code from the compiler's point of view this way, but
it becomes pain in the ass for the developer.

But, enough of that, I didn't like FlashPunk (way too heavy for my puritan taste), 
but I really liked the minimalistic approach of Flixel so went with it, so far so good even though Flixel is aimed
towards "platformers", so I had to kind of reinvent the wheel; it well worth the effort.

Flixel is definitely *defacto* for platformers, enough said! Go, find out who 
is [Adam Atomic](https://github.com/AdamAtomic) now?

### Deadline?

We kind of missed the *deadline*, December 24th, we'll finish the game, I just wasn't
that productive as I thought I would be, being on vacation has tons of distractions,
there are guests all the time, etc, etc. I still stand up tall behind my belief about
having an office, otherwise you'll never get stuff done, even if it's just for the 
weekends. 

People might disagree with me about this one, there are people who can work just as 
fine in a *home* environment; I'm just picking on you because I like you!

In overall, doing this small scale 2D project proven to be very very useful for
both of us, validating ourselves as a team; it's useless to put talented people
together in the same room, but who cannot *work* with each other for whatever reasons,
then try managing them; that's worse than *herding cats* believe me.

It's not that bad, all the artwork is done, so hopefully the game will be out as well
in a week or two with full GPLed source code, so watch out for it, 
and it will also be available in the Chrome Web Store.

The Chrome Web Store can offer a huge exposure for your Web 2.0 product (not just games),
compared to the infamous *portals* . (the wise indies have their games in there already)

Indiega.me
----------

There's never a time for me to be focused only on a single project; My attention span is
huge and it involves at least 3 side projects, which I like to call my dirty little
pleasures, if I may be so bold; these projects can vary from reverse engineering (in order
to satisfy my strong taste for patterns) to plugins for various software and everything
in-between.

By now you are probably wondering, why on Earth I'm telling you all this when the subtitle
was [Indiega.me](http://indiega.me) ?

*Twinkle, twinkle little star ...*, ah wait this was for another post, damn 
copy-paste ... bleah!

In one of my inspired moments, while searching for yet not taken domain names involving
the words *indie* and *game*, it struck me out of nowhere and to my surprise it wasn't
registered, so I took it without looking back.

The next logical question is what I'm going to use it for? All I can tell you now is that
it will be a small *web product*, obviously *indie game* related and *open source*, but
again more on this in 2011. *chuckle*

Linux as a primary game development platform
--------------------------------------------
You are like *oh my god* already, which is fine! I discussed this subject briefly before,
but I'm going to dive into it again, touching a couple of different issues.

If you tell somebody that you are building a cross platform game engine from **scratch**
their first reaction is like *are you out of your mind?*, there are a lot of good ones
out there and besides that *you are going to build it on your own? you should be make games instead* ... 

My first reaction to these is something like *i beg your pardon, but show me one of those
super awesome cross platform open source game engine which have been used in more than 1-2
(successful, very very important aspect we should not lose sight of) commercial titles*.

You can mention Ogre ( [Runic Games](http://www.runicgames.com/) and their [Torchlight](http://www.torchlightgame.com/) ) 
if you are brave enough and pretty much that's about it, but still won't answer my question.

First of all there are no real open source game engines, but graphics engines at most, which is a 
huge difference.

Don't get me wrong, I perfectly understand the following things:

* You are building games and not game engines and tools.
* You don't care about the underlying technology and the adverse affects of
viral dependencies. (i.e proprietary crapware like XNA)
* You don't mind paying expensive licenses for technology without the full
source code.
* You don't mind to be limited to or be at the discretion of a certain tool
like Unity, Shiva, UDK without the possibility to break through or study
the inner workings. (in other words you don't care about *your freedom*)
* You don't care about Linux or Mac OSX, who cares? Wind0ze rul3z!
* You don't have the necessary resources to roll your own technology 
(we both know that this is damn lame excuse)

The things mentioned above are true for most of the indie game developer community,
the so called *professional* developers don't have much to say because their hands
are tied by managers and publishers; which again is a very very lame excuse.

The major bottleneck of the existing open source engines is their very own license. All of them
are distributed under *liberal* BSD or MIT like licenses and this is their nemesis.

I also understand that the *developers* don't want to generate any revenue, which is quite
nice of them, but a BSD like license won't make any difference, it will make things even
worse.

No sane company or even independent professionals, (unless it's a hobby project which won't have significant impact anyway; [Runic Games](http://www.runicgames.com) is brave and quite bold exception) 
will invest time and money adding features, fixing bugs, etc. with a BSD like license.

Why? The reason is a very obvious one, if company X can take it and make their own
closed source fork (pointing at Apple, gotcha!), it just doesn't worth it for 
company Y to invest significant amount of resources and help company X indirectly.

A true game engine is almost like a mini operating system, with the *kernel* or *core*
managing and providing access to hundreds of little components.

If the Linux Kernel wasn't under a GPL license, Linux would be nowhere near where is today with
major companies contributing thousands of patches each month, you can take that for granted.

Another systemic problem is that there are no companies backing up commercially these infamous
*engines*, limiting their area of exposure and credibility by orders of magnitude.

Don't get me started when it comes to the architecture of these systems; put 10 senior software
engineers in a room and tell them to create the perfect architecture, what you'll get? you'll
get a huge MESS like Ogre or Irrlicht.

At most 1-2 people can create the core architecture and then have a larger group,
preferably early adopters test the feel of the API, by providing input on how tie up the
loose ends, how to make it more accessible, more friendly and provide non-mission
critical patches. Any major changes/features, (i.e rewriting an existing sub-system) 
should be discussed with the core team beforehand in order to avoid duplication of effort, 
frustration (i.e the *patch* is not accepted) and other issues that may arise.

Also, in order to maintain the quality upstream, you cannot just let any code get into
your master branch. (TrollTech) Qt's way of accepting contributions works great IMHO, and
it's ideal for large scale projects.

There are indies who roll their own well written and totally reusable
(between projects) closed source custom technology like [Frictional Games](http://www.frictionalgames.com/)
(they just [earlier this year] open sourced their previous generation of the technology HPL1),
 or like the now defunct [Radon Labs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_Labs) and their [Nebula Device](http://nebuladevice.cubik.org/) engine, which is clearly the best
(speaking of internals and architecture, maybe a little bit overengineered, sorry Floh)
and only (open?!) game engine out there with several commercial titles (with limited success) 
under its belt.

Never wondered why Nebula Device never took off? It had a very very liberal license
*Do whatever you want with it, but give us credit* and it still didn't make a damn
difference; early adopters, solid documentation, a streamlined patch/fix submission
process are a few of the key elements to run a successful large scale open source
project like a game engine; true *free software* licenses will help
to gain credibility and stability, by assuring your potential customers that the 
product will stay and it's just as rock solid as any other commercial alternative
and even more, they have full control over every tiny aspect, there are no hidden
API calls, fees, or whatever marketing mockery you can think of.

Inadvertently, Linux suffers from the lack of commercial quality open source game engines,
games are pushing Windows, if there were no games people would just go and better use 
OS X for their office and photo/video editing needs like most people already do.

The chicken-egg problem persists and haunts Linux even now, when the %1 Linux users
is just a Myth of the past, Microsoft losing their share of the pie on the Desktop
every minute, obviously there is a long way to the top, but we are getting there
with emerging markets like Net-books dominated by various Linux distributions.

Fair play and competition is good, healthy, that is what makes the world spinning around.

I have the feeling that in the game industry, when I say game industry, I think about
EA, UbiSoft and other big shots, the perception of Linux being a tiny platforms persists
still, I'm saying that after finding out that Epic games is dropping the idea of having
Unreal Tournament on Linux for good, and others just refuse to release Linux ports, when you
pay $60 for a *triple A* game, it would be nice if you could play it under Linux, without Wine
and other *hacks* .

In closing ...
--------------
Together with Melissa, we'll do the *right* things, not the wrong things beautifully.

Oh well, I'm looking forward to a great 2011, Lera Games will kick some serious ass, most
things work out when you expect them less to quote a *wise and intelligent man* called Me.

Damn, spent my whole day refining and tweaking this post, it should be ready to
go by now ...

Feel free to comment if you got anything interesting to say, otherwise please remember,
*there is no I in a team, but there are three Us in shut the fuck up* ...

There are at least a zillion of other things I missed and would like to write about, but
I'll write a book one day ... entitled *Piercing the heart in 10 words* and it will include
it all ...

Until next year, as server said ... Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everyone.

(ppsstt ... yes! Trolls included! but don't tell to anyone!)
