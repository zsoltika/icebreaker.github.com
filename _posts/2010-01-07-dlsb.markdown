According to the <a title="Programmer Personality Test" href="http://ppt.doolwind.com/" target="_blank">programmer personality test</a> my programmer personality type is DLSB, which is about right because I'm a hardcore c/c++ and optimization freak; I do "web" stuff just for fun :)

<strong>You're a <span style="font-size: large;">D</span>oer.</strong>
You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most  important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better.After all, time is money.

<strong>You like coding at a <span style="font-size: large;">L</span>ow level.</strong>
You're from the old school of programming and believe that you should have an intimate relationship with the computer. You don't mind juggling registers around and spending hours getting a 5% performance increase in an algorithm.


<strong>You work best in a <span style="font-size: large;">S</span>olo situation.</strong>
The best way to program is by yourself. There's no communication problems, you know every part of the code allowing you to write the best programs possible.


<strong>You are a li<span style="font-size: large;">B</span>eral programmer.</strong>
Programming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We're not writing on paper anymore  										so we can take up as much room as we need.
