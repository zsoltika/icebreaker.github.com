Today I released Tiny3D under GPL license -- my very own framework for writing 3D visualizer plugins for Winamp 5+. It also includes the "demo" why this framework was born. More info and the sources can be found over <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nympho3d/" title=")" target="_blank">here</a>.It was written in the last few days, so don't expect too much ... haha!
