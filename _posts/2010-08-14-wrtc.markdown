### QuakeCon 2010

Just about two days ago at QuakeCon 2010, John announced the release of the integral source code of *Wolfenstein: Return to Castle*
and *Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory* both using modified versions of idTech3 (Quake3).

This is another significant contribution to the open source community, even though some of us were expecting idTech4 (Doom3).

More on this over [here](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/29903/QuakeCon_id_Software_Releases_Source_Code_For_Two_Wolfenstein_Titles.php) .
 
### Build, Build, Build

I quickly grabbed the source code of the SP version (**Return to Castle**) and compiled it without any problems in less than a minute
on my Linux Box.

I don't own the *original* **Return to Castle** game so I searched for the demo version and copied the PAK file containing the game data. 

Everything worked fine, except the sound which can be fixed easily:

{% highlight bash %}
su
echo "wolfsp.x86 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
{% endhighlight %}

I'm curious to see how the community will start cleaning up the code base just like it did with the good old idTech3. ( [ioquake](http://ioquake3.org/) )
