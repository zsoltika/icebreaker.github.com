I just stumbled across <a href="http://regexxer.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Reggexer</a> today while searching for a tool to replace stuff in multiple files in an easy and convenient way.

<a class="image" href="/images/2008/08/screenshot-regexxer.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-286" title="screenshot-regexxer" src="/images/2008/08/screenshot-regexxer-400x300.png" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a>

Just as it says on it's homepage, my first thought was <em>"Hey,           I must have this!" :)</em>
