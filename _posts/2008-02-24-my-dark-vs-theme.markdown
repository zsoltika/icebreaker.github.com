I am in the race for a good "dark" theme for some time now, but today I just came up with my very own one ... haha!

When it comes to fixed size fonts, I prefer "Monaco" :D Also the guy who proposed that "blue" background for Borland C, Borland Pascal, etc was really clever ... haha.

Here is a screenshot with my very own theme.

If you like it, you can download it right <a href="http://nympho3d.googlecode.com/files/blueish.zip" title="Click here to download!" target="_blank">here</a> .
