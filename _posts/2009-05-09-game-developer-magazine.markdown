Game Developer Magazine, is just purely awesome, the quality of the content is just breath taking, worth every single cent, so yesterday for just 19.95$, I subscribed ( 6 months ) and got my "bonus issues" :)
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="image" href="/images/2009/05/0904gd_cover_576x780.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-540 aligncenter" title="0904gd_cover_576x780" src="/images/2009/05/0904gd_cover_576x780-295x399.jpg" alt="0904gd_cover_576x780" width="295" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'll definitely be a regular subscriber after the current one is over.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PS: Already started devorating the issues from April :))</p>
