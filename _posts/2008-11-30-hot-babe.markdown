<h2>What's Hot-Babe?</h2>
Hot-babe is a small graphical utility which displays the system activity in a very special way.  When the CPU is idle, it displays a dressed girl, and when the activity goes up, as the temperature increases, the girl begins to undress, to finish totally naked when the system activity reaches 100%. Of course, if you can be shocked by nudity, don't use it!</blockquote>

Pretty cool, but it's gets boring after a while, even though it's a cool way to spice up your desktop.

Enjoy :)
