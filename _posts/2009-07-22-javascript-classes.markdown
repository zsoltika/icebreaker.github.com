The one thing I love about YUI is the nice "extend" function which makes everything sooooo much more beautiful and gives almost that nice C++ 'like' object oriented feeling.

Now, YUI is quite heavy, even with all the compression, etc. so I came up with a very light-weight extend implementation.

<a class="image" href="/images/2009/07/extends.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646" title="extends" src="/images/2009/07/extends-500x313.png" alt="extends" width="500" height="313" /></a>

It's nothing new (or extremely brilliant), except that it works just like the "extend" from YUI; the source code can be found right <a title="Click to get the source code!" href="http://github.com/icebreaker/js-magick/" target="_blank">here</a> .

Public domain, enjoy :)
