I've been living with GEdit + a few plugins, but today I moved my project to Eclipse with the C/C++ extensions. It took a bit longer to setup everything, but in the end, I got everything plus a lot more.

<a class="image" href="{{ site.url }}/images/2008/07/screenshot-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-263" title="Eclipse" src="{{ site.url }}/images/2008/07/screenshot-1-400x132.png" alt="" width="400" height="132" /></a>

I also customized the color scheme a bit and changed the font to Bitstream Vera Sans Mono .
