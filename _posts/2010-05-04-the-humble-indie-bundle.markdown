I purchased World of Goo before, but this was something I just couldn't refuse so I spent **10$** on it. I know it's not much, but hey it's more than nothing.

In one hour (after I purchased) the 'Real Time Statistics' showing the total number of raised funds bumped from **$10,000** to more than **$26,000**.

Go and [grab](http://www.wolfire.com/humble) your bundle today .
