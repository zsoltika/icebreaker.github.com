A new Skype beta was released for Linux, which finally has Video support. I quickly grabbed and installed it on my Ubuntu system. It works perfectly with the integrated webcam in my toshiba sattelita a200 pro :))) I'm happy with it.

I guess this will be a major hit for aMSN, Pidgin, etc, because they all lack the Video support and isn't planned in the near future for either of them.

Hip-Hip ... Hoooraay! Go you Skype!
