<em>I want a girl with a kernel like a diamond
I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl who ctrl +x's to cut
And eyes that burn like cigarettes

I want a girl with the right memory allocations
Who is funny and witty
And geeky as a white hat
She's playing with her compiler
She's putting up her source
She's touring the lab
And picking up slackware

I want a geek girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

I want a girl who plays games early
I want a girl who stays up late
I want a girl with uninterrupted uptime
Who uses a debugger to hunt down mem leaks
With fingernails that shine like justice And hair that is red like fire

Who is funny and witty
And geeky as a black hat
She's touring the lab
And picking up slackware

I want a geek girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

I want a girl with a smooth leather cuirass
I want a girl with good stat rolls
At a gaming session we will meet accidentally
We'll start to talk when she borrows my dice

She wants a computer that is penguin powered
She wants a computer that will get things done
She's changing her name from Kitty to Karen
She's trading her win box for a white Apple laptop

I want a geek girl with a short skirt and a long jacket</em>
