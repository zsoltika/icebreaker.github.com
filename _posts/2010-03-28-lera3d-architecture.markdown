It's kind of late, but I'm going to post this anyway. **Yawn** .

I've been always talking about Lera3D up and Lera3D down, but never posted anything tangible, so here we are rocking around the clock.

As you can see, everything is a plug-in, including the *core* itself; this allows 100% control and
full customization of every aspect of the engine, the **end-user** can swap any plug-in
by buying an alternate or just writing his / her own. (assuming that all plug-ins are well written
and the exposed interfaces are flexible enough to make different implementations possible).

[Lemon Tea](http://www.szabster.net/tag/lemontea) has its place as well in the **big picture** ... can you find it? even though he's not
using Lera3D as of now, it has a completely different **small** built-in engine, but
this will change as it matures (hopefully!?!) .

I will write more about this tomorrow; by splitting up the **core** and explaining a couple of
the existing features, plus giving a long awaited update on the progress with [Lemon Tea](http://www.szabster.net/tag/lemontea).

Until tomorrow (ah shit it's tomorrow already ... grrr), as server said ...

(**yawn**)
