Alas, last week my precious Toshiba "war-machine" died, apparently it wasn't the charger (since then I verified it, it provices 19v), neither the battery because the battery was still lasting up to 2 hours.

I'm hoping that it's just some internal soldering problem at the DC's input, and that I won't have to replace the whole motherboard, because in that case I will rather buy another <em>brand new</em> laptop :)

So, until I get that fixed (hopefully ... *fingers crossed*) I put my Wibrain to work ( my EEE PC would be way to slow for *compiling* ) .

It works quite well with my 17' widescreen monitor ... so here is my setup ...

Not bad huh? I would say, not bad at all! :))
