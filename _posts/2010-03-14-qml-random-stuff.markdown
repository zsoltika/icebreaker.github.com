### QML

I'm using the bleeding edge versions of both QT and QT Creator straight from the Git(orious) repositories; doing so has a couple
of benefits, but also drawbacks mostly because some of this bleeding edge stuff may break :)

How do I test / use all these? 

It's quite simple, I have my **/opt** mounted on a 10GB partition and I install qt and qt creator
there via 'make install' then just make sure that all the utilities (i.e qmake) are in my path (all the libs in LD_LIBRARY_PATH), so basically
I can even have multiple versions installed without breaking the "stable" versions residing in **/usr** or **/usr/local** .

I also discovered this awesome 'Boxes' demo, I have no idea how long this have been part of the demos, but it's really awesome.

Sooooo *drum rolls* **finally** I was able to get my hands on QML and test it without way any headache as it has landed
into the 4.7 branch.

With this at my fingertips I was also able to compile QT Creator with the QML related plug-ins enabled. **yaaaayyy**!!?!

Here is a short video demoing the 'SameGame' example (part of the declarative samples); it was played and recorded using the
*official* QML viewer bundled with QT.

Total and complete **AWESOMENESS**!!!

### Time?

I'm not going to write about *wasting* time, but basically I spent my time playing around with the [0.A.D](http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/) code base 
[more on this later] updating and recompiling QT and its friends, plus took a few decisions regarding Lera3D's engine architecture .

The weekend is not over **yet**, so there's a lot more to do! *Go, go, power ranger!*

### 0.A.D code base

[ this should be a completely separate post, but I'm just being **lazy** ]

[0.A.D](http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/) is developed by [Wildfire](http://wildfiregames.com/) games and recently (a year ago or so) have been open sourced. 
I blogged about this last year when I just compiled and pretty much forgot about it.

Yesterday I said, lets look at the source code again. I'm interested mostly in the rendering part, including the different rendering
paths (fixed or shader), etc.

( a couple of *fresh* screens )

The actual code base is quite messy and not everything is clearly separated or grouped together where necessary.

Soo, the *"maths"*, in addition to the *usual* VectorND and Matrix classes the Plane and Bound can be a valuable source of inspiration
especially the Ray Intersection (& Bounding Box) stuff which is useful for *picking* . This is definitely
the first place to look when investigating a renderer.

Lets digg further ... **source/lib/** contains some of the *low-level* including some OpenGL related stuff.

Points of interest in **source/lib/**:

* ogl.h (basic util stuff like "ogl_HaveExtension", etc)
* ogl.cpp
* glext_funcs.h (>OpenGL 1.1 i.e glActiveTexture and other ARB stuff)

**source/ps/** contains more low-level stuff, some of these should be in **source/lib/** like CStr or the FileSystem, and Vector2D should be
most definitely inside "Maths".

IMHO, most of this directory should be merged with **source/graphics/**.

**source/graphics/** contains higher-level Game related stuff which basically sits on the top of **source/renderer** so maybe it would be
a good idea to merge all these into the **renderer** . [The frustum.* and camera.* code is definitely interesting.]

In **source/renderer** the render paths are OK, they are well separated but I feel like it has been over engineered, it's clearly visible
that all these parts have been hacked together in order to create something which works rather than designing it carefully .

An example of this hacky design from **source/renderer/Renderer.cpp**:

{% highlight cpp %}
bool CRenderer::IsTextureTransparent(CTexture* texture)
{
	if (!texture) return false;
	Handle h=texture->GetHandle();
 
	size_t flags = 0;   // assume no alpha on failure
	(void)ogl_tex_get_format(h, &flags, 0);
	return (flags & TEX_ALPHA) != 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This should have been part of the actual CTexture class (maybe as a static member) and not the CRenderer class; it's easy to see that
the guys behind 0.A.D are primarily Windows developers, the code tells it all.

There are huge dependencies like [Boost](http://www.boost.org) or [Xerces](http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/), personally I would get rid of these, 
especially [Boost](http://www.boost.org) which is a TRUE monster.

Oh well, this is not a complete code base analysis or anything, just a few very *personal* thoughts, don't pay attention if you don't want to.

[ Hear me NOW, believe me later. ]

Maybe, I will contribute to 0.A.D, who knows ... :) Lady who? **BUG**!!!

Until next time as **server** *said* ...
