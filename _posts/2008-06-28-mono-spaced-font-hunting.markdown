I do lots of coding in different languages and under Linux, I use the excellent light-weight GEdit. It's really important to find a color scheme + font which really suits your needs, because you need a pleasant environment to work in on day to day basis.

I found the theme, which is the <em>text-mate like</em> <em>"DarkMate"</em> ( if I remember well I posted about this one ), as for the font I was oscillating between <em>"MonoSpace"</em> and <em>"DejaVu Sans Mono"</em> ... here they are side by side:

<em><strong>MonoSpace</strong></em>

<a class="image" href="/images/2008/06/gedit_monospace.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-236" title="gedit_monospace" src="/images/2008/06/gedit_monospace-400x221.png" alt="" width="400" height="221" /></a>

<em><strong>DejaVu Sans Mono</strong></em>

<a class="image" href="/images/2008/06/dejavu_sans_mono_gedit.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-237" title="dejavu_sans_mono_gedit" src="/images/2008/06/dejavu_sans_mono_gedit-400x221.png" alt="" width="400" height="221" /></a>

Well, there is no big difference between the two, but recently I stumbled across the <em>"Droid Sans Mono</em>", here is a screenshot:

<a class="image" href="/images/2008/06/droid_sans_mono_gedit.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-238" title="droid_sans_mono_gedit" src="/images/2008/06/droid_sans_mono_gedit-400x221.png" alt="" width="400" height="221" /></a>

This has that smoothed <em>MacOSX like</em> font look, so this is definitely <em>the droid I was looking for</em> so long!

Since is it distributed under the <em>Apache license</em>, I also uploaded a copy just in case it disappears from the other locations. You can grab it right <a class="image" href="/images/2008/06/droidsansmono.zip">here</a> .

Happy Coding!
