Here is a major update for the 3D SlideShow prototype thingy I released last weekend ( see my previous <a title="Part One!" href="{{ site.url }}/2009/08/09/3d-slideshow/" target="_blank">post</a> on how to obtain the source code ).

I added a nice configuration dialog, and replaced the --monitor X command line argument with --config which forces the dialog to appear even when "Don't show this again" is checked.

<a class="image" href="{{ site.url }}/images/2009/08/config.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-658" title="config" src="{{ site.url }}/images/2009/08/config-499x301.png" alt="config" width="499" height="301" /></a>

Note: 'Dive into sub-directories' has no effect as of now :P'
