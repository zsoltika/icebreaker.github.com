Today, I stumbled across this blog <a href="http://theunixgeek.wordpress.com/">TheUnixGeek</a> and discovered the following:

<a class="image" href="/images/2009/06/epicfail.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-596" title="epicfail" src="/images/2009/06/epicfail.png" alt="epicfail" width="447" height="137" /></a>

<em><strong>EPIC FAIL!!!! </strong></em>(Fellow programmers (but not only) will know what I'm talking about <em>*cough, cough*</em>)

IMHO, one shouldn't publish stuff on the internet unless he really has something to say, and HE IS ABSOLUTELY sure that he fully understands the given TOPIC.

It's always wise to evaluate your skills before getting into something, because it's totally useless wasting your time trying to 'build' something; you know from the very begining that you just can't.

Just my two eurocents ... apples and oranges ... LOL
