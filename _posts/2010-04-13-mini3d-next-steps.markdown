### Next Steps

I didn't really test **Mini3D** on Minefield (Firefox) or Safari and it seems that there are some 'recursion' problems
caused by my way of doing class inheritance on these two, so I'll fix this issue later on this week.

On the other hand I saw this dirty little game and I do believe that a clone like this would be
perfect to showcase some interesting features:

<object width="500" height="405"><param wmode="transparent"/><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kP313e-Xk_s&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kP313e-Xk_s&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="transparent" width="500" height="405"></embed></object>

Eventually we can take it to a new level by adding multiplayer via WebSockets, randomly generated levels, or other 'procedurally' generated content.

### Thoughts ...

I just launched it barely two days ago and people already showed interest which is rewarding considering that at this point is the result of
two weekends of work ...

Also, I wanna checkout the WebGL implementation in Chromium and eventually fix or contribute things ... we'll see ...

### End of Line
