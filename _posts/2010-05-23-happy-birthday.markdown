First of all **Happy Birthday** (++) to my *special*, *unique* and **very** *lovely* **fiancee** *Valeria*. :D

The soundtrack is *Flying on the Wings of Steam* by *Chris Vrenna*. (For obvious reasons, I cannot redistribute it).

### LD Prototype

LD Prototype is a (portable) mini framework I wrote for [Ludum Dare 17](http://www.ludumdare.com/), but I didn't manage to finish the intended *game*, 
mostly because I spent all my time writing the 'framework' from scratch. Waiting for Ludum Dare 18 :P ...

Don't expect too much, but it's definitely OK for small prototypes. It has all the basic stuff like wrappers for texture, shader
and geometry handling, *abstract* renderer, simple math classes, etc.

It has a couple of design flaws, but hey this is most definitely not production quality code by no means :)

### Look into my garden 

*Valeria's* birthday was approaching, so I decided to play around with some [Bezier curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) and code this small demo before releasing
the framework to the general public. 

I like to give credit where credit is due, my primary source of inspiration was the [Sunflower](http://www.pixelnerve.com/v/2008/10/20/sunflower/) demo;
I re-used/borrowed a couple of textures from there.

(Horrible *sync* and *camera* handling, you won't believe it until you see it for yourself :P)

The whole source code is on GitHub and can be reached by clicking right [here](https://github.com/icebreaker/LDPrototype) .

*PS: Steampunk piece of shit :P*

OK, OK ... I'm off now ... you know ... sleep is a very very good substitute for Coke. *sigh*
