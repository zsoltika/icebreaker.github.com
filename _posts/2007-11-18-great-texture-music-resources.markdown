Well, if you are an lone wolf developer like I am, and you want some nice textures and music then you should check out these two websites, and most probably you will find something you like. Of course I'm assuming that your productions won't be commercial, lol -- so you will be able to use them :P

I'm planning on using some resources from these to commit a few experimental "scene demos/intros/games" in the near future :) with my new 3D engine :P but shhh, everything at its time :))
