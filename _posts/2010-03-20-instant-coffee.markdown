### Idea

The idea behind **Instant Coffee** was born **yesterday** when I was looking for some awesome editor with *What You See Is What You Get* capabilities and built-in support for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) .

### Coffee, Coffee, Coffee

I took [John Fraser's](http://attacklab.net/showdown/) [Showdown](http://attacklab.net/showdown/) which is a Javascript port of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), built a desktop app which loads it into a QWebView and adds some basic operations like open, save, export as html, etc.

Since I switched to a Jekyll generated blog, I write all my posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) , but I wanted instant visual feedback to see how my text looks like as I'm typing ... here we are.

This is a prototype, but it's perfectly enough for my basic editing needs, feel free to fork it, hack it, then submit a pull request; any contribution is more than welcome!

The source code can be found on GitHub as usual right [here](http://github.com/icebreaker/instantcoffee) .

**Instant Coffee** is another prime example, just like [SexyGrep]({{ site.url }}/2010/01/23/sexygrep/) of converting a web app into a desktop app using QT and WebKit, we really don't need Adobe Air and other proprietary bullshit.
