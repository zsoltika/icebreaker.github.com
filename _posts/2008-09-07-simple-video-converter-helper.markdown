I made this little script to be able to convert - resize videos easily, without typing in kilometric strings into the terminal.

It's not the most elegant script you ever seen, but hey, it works :)

As always, make it executable and put it in a safe place like /usr/bin :P

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

# Author: Icebreaker
# Description: Resize a video to 1280x720 (HD).
# I'm using this script to resize videos to 1280x720
# ( maintaining the source quality )
# which can be posted to Vimeo.com for example and be converted
# automatically to a HD quality  video.
#
# This could be done a lot more elegantly ... I'm sure, but it does
# the job for me and that's all what matters :)
#
# The argument "parsing" is not completely n00b proof :P
#
# PS: vimeo.com is cool :P
#
# Requires: ffmpeg
