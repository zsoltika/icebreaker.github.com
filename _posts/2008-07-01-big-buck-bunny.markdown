A while back I posted about a similar movie created by the <em>Orange Open Project</em> using entirely with open source software (Blender, etc), it was called <em>Elephants Dream</em>, and now here we go again with <em>Big Buck Bunny</em> ... Be sure to check out the project at <a title="Go!" href="http://www.bigbuckbunny.org" target="_blank">BigBuckBunny.org</a> and download the movie.
