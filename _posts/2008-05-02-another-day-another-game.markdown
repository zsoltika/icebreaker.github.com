As I'm a developer myself (i'm writing my own cross-platform 3d engine), I love to check out different game sources which can be a valuable inspiration source when it comes to engine design, etc.

Todays game is <strong>Battle Thanks</strong>, a 2D tank arcade game with multiplayer and split screen modes.

I grabbed the sources and compiled it, because I prefer to compile myself where possible rather than installing precompiled packages.

( it uses "scons" instead of automake, or jam )

... here is an in-game screenshot:

If I raised your interest check it out <a href="http://btanks.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">here</a> .
