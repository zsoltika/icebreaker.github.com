I'm posting this, mostly because some people showed interest in how do I customized my Ubuntu's look and feel. So here we go ... an image worths more than 1 million words ... ha!

First take a look at the following screenshot.

<a title="screenshot.png" class="image" href="{{ site.url }}/images/2008/01/screenshot.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2008/01/screenshot.png" border="0" alt="screenshot.png" width="420" height="240" /></a>

Nice huh? If you liked what you have seen, then continue, else STOP reading now.

The background can be found <a title="Roar!" href="http://icebreaker.wordpress.com/2008/04/13/rip/" target="_self">here</a> .

The theme is customized, so here are some screenshots:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2008/01/screenshot-customize-theme.png" alt="screenshot-customize-theme.png" />

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2008/01/screenshot-customize-theme-1.png" alt="screenshot-customize-theme-1.png" />

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2008/01/screenshot-customize-theme-2.png" alt="screenshot-customize-theme-2.png" />

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2008/01/screenshot-customize-theme-3.png" alt="screenshot-customize-theme-3.png" />

Now a few words about the panel on the bottom. Well that's not the Kiba dock, that's just a normal dock. So here is an image on how to set that up  to achieve the look and feel of the one in the screenshot.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2008/01/screenshot-panel-properties.png" alt="screenshot-panel-properties.png" />

The themes, etc. are from either <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org" target="_blank">Gnome Look</a> or <a href="http://art.gnome.org" target="_blank">Gnome Art</a> .<a href="http://art.gnome.org" target="_blank"> </a>

Enjoy indefinitely .... haha!
